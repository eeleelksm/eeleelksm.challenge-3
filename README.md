# Password Generator Starter Code

In this challenge, we were asked to complete the starter code to create a Password Generator. The Password Generator should ask the user how many characters they would like in their password and if they would like uppercase, lowercase, numerical, and/or special characters.

The following Password Generator I created can be found here: https://eeleelksm.github.io/eeleelksm.challenge3/

# Screenshots
When the user navigates to the page, they should see the following page.

When the 'Generate Password' button is clicked, the user see a welcome message "Welcome to the Password Generator.

When Close/Ok is selected, the user then sees the first prompt: "How many characters would you like in your password? Choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters." This will tell you "Invalid entry. Please try again." if the number entered is less than 8, more than 128, or is not an integer.

The user then goes through additional prompts asking if they'd like uppercase, lowercase, numerical, and/or special characters. The user can type either "No" or press Cancel to move to the next prompt and not included those characters in their password. If the user selects yes, the window then confirms their selection and moves on the next question.

Once completed into the last prompt, the Password Generator confirms that the password has been generated and if the user would like a new password, they will have to reload the page.
